Plaintexts and the power consumption during the first encryption round are provided in two files:
Line i of "traces.txt.bz2" contains the power consumption of the first AES round when encrypting line i of "plaintexts.txt.bz2" with the secret key.
You are also provided with a (plaintext, ciphertext) pair so that you can check the correctness of your answer:

Sample plaintext: 253  110  6  137  98  242  99  61  245  169  175  139  29  252  181  33  
Sample ciphertext: 26  68  116  209  44  188  127  153  140  86  177  13  78  68  0  28  

You also know that the leftmost byte of the key is zero.
The flag is: SharifCTF{key} where "key" is the AES key in hexadecimal, without the 0x prefix.
